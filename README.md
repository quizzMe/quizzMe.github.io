# Quiz System - QuizzMe
QuizzMe is a free web application for creating, managing and solving quizzes in categories by choice.

QuizzMe is a SPA (Single Page Application) made as a school project, which serves as a way to practice and master my skills currently gained at SoftUni. The project aims to practice concepts like Asynchronous Programming, using a remote server (BaaS), CRUD operations, User Authentication, Client Side Rendering (Templating Concepts), Routing, Component Approach and others.
