# Quiz System - QuizzMe
QuizzMe is a free web application for creating, managing and solving quizzes in categories by choice.

QuizzMe is a SPA (Single Page Application) made as a school project, which serves as a way to practice and master my skills currently gained at SoftUni. The project aims to practice concepts like Asynchronous Programming, using a remote server (BaaS), CRUD operations, User Authentication, Client Side Rendering (Templating Concepts), Routing, Component Approach and others.


## Features
* User registration
* Each user has a profile, which contains statistics for the current user - their results, filtered from highest to lowest, as well as all the quizzes created by them
* User Authentication - only logged in users can solve and create quizzes. Only quiz author can edit or delete their own quizzes. A guest can only browse through the quizzes.
* Diffrent topics, by which quizzes can be filtered
* Interactive quizz editor
* Timer, which tracks the time for taking the quizz. When the time is over the quiz submits automatically as it is in the moment the time ends. The amount of time is set up by the quiz author.
* QuizzMe is a responsive application, meaning it can be used on all devices - mobile, tablets, PC
